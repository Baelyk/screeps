# To-do List

## Creeps

- If builders have an assigned construction, they will not repair. This could to builders ignoring stuctures needing repair until they decay
- Non harvester creeps can't block sources
- Creeps dance between containers if the closest one is just barely getting filled
- If miners can harvest more energy than they can carry, they drop the surplus

## Structures

### Roads

- Road to all sources in room
- Road linking containers
- Road to upgrader
- Road to idle location
- Wider roads in frequent/important path areas

### Spawns

- Heal creeps, don't just let them die
