# To-do List

## Creeps

- Multiple miners per source, based on tiles around the source
- If builders have an assigned construction, they will not repair. This could to builders ignoring stuctures needing repair until they decay
- Non harvester creeps can't block sources
- Creeps dance between containers if the closest one is just barely getting filled

## Structures

### Roads

- Road to all sources in room
- Road linking containers
- Road to upgrader
- Road to idle location

### Spawns

- Heal creeps, don't just let them die
- Decide how to update population limits
